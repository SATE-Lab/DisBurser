DisBurser(**Di**stributed **S**ystems **Bu**gs **R**eproduced for **S**oftware **E**ngineering **R**esearch) is a infrastructure or the **deterministic** reproduction of distributed system failures. DisBurser provides both a dataset of known distributed-systems bugs and a toolset, called Redit. 

<!-- With dockers running on the machine, we can easily simulate the operation of a real-world distributed system on Redit and find defects of the system by the test events.

Currently, node failure, network partition, network delay, network packet loss, and clock drift is supported.

For Java, we can force a specific order between nodes in order to reproduce a specific time-sensitive scenario and inject failures before or after a specific method is called when a specific stack trace is present. -->

User guide will soon be uploaded.
